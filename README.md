# Replication of Shapiro and Walker (2018)

This repository covers the model used in Shapiro and Walker (2018): Why is pollution from US manufacturing declining? The roles of environmental regulation, productivity, and trade. *American Economic Review*, 108(12), 3814-3854. Paper and original replication data and code can be found at AER's website: https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20151272



In this

, I summarize the equilibrium equations that are crucial for quantification and analyze the counterfactual. Several replications and extensions are conducted to illustrate how the model explains changes in pollution emissions. I show detailed derivations and include MATLAB code to in the appendix.



[DataCode]: https://github.com/luowenjie1/Replication_SW2018/tree/main/DataCode

folder has the program solving the model and counterfactual. I have included necessary comments. The main program is 
[MAIN_SW2018.m]: https://github.com/luowenjie1/Replication_SW2018/blob/main/DataCode/MAIN_SW2018.m

which generates figures stored at the figure folder.
